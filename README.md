## Program Flow
Curious user views website and selects their model/models to see if they would wound another unit enough to make their attack worth it. This program runs a single simulation, but you could run multiple to get a feel for how many wounds your models apply.


## Future Additions

 1. Simulate more instances of combat and display an average
 2. Add functionality for cover or buffs
